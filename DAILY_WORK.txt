Jun 1:
Booted up the repo for the final project. Finally finished the design phase and moved up to the coding phase. So far only started working on the game class. 
Pygame window works, there is just nothing in it.
Only problem was that there was some issue importing the github repo into replit. 

June 5:
Initialized all the images in the asset folder to variables and a list
started working on the tile class, but its not completed as of now. 
plan on working on board class tmr. 

June 6:
drew the board, started on placing mines function. 
only problem today was the nested for loop for board_list which took way longer than it should have. tmr will continue on placing mines and maybe also calculating the clues for each surrounding tile.
